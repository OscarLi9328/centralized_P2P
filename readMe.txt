1. Make sure the machine has installed python3 or above

2. Use command "python server.py" to run the server end and "python client.py" to run the client end

3. At the beginning of the program, user has to specify which machine is going to be connected and get its IP address. Or instead, connect to local terminal by entering '127.0.0.1' into the prompt.

4. Next, user has to specify the port that will later be used for data sharing. Note that this port cannot be the same port as the default port 12345 or any other commonly used default port such as 80. 

5. After this, the server, client connection should be established. User can start entering the commands: "register", "listing", "location", "leave".

Note: 'test', and 'client.c' are the testing files.Welcome to P2P community!
